1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure your device is fully charged (at least 60%).

   - Download the ROM file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/104IIcL9n50athA5HV6Pg0ig0TIqzjaFf/view?usp=drivesdk) and place it in the root of your internal storage or SD card.

2. **Preparation**:
   - Boot your device into Recovery Mode (Power + Volume Up buttons).
   - Ensure you have a custom recovery installed (TWRP or similar).

3. **Installation**:
   - In Recovery Mode, select `Wipe` and perform a factory reset (optional but recommended for a clean install).
   - Go back to the main menu and select `Install`.
   - Navigate to the ROM file you downloaded and select it.
   - Swipe to confirm the installation.

4. **Post-Installation**:
   - Once installation is complete, select `Reboot System`.
   - Your device will reboot into the new ROM. The first boot might take a bit longer than usual.

5. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If you encounter boot loops or errors, try reinstalling the ROM or restoring your device to factory settings.
